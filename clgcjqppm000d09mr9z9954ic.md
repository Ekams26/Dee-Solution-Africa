If you are thinking of diving into the tech space, particularly the coding aspect, Python is your go-to guy. It’s a good way to start your journey. This is because Python is quite simple and easy to use, making it great for beginners.

### What is Python?

Python is a type of computer language that can be used to create programs or software, and unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to spend extra time compiling the code before you can run it. Instead, you can immediately run your code once you have written it and see the output. It’s quick and efficient, which is why it's your go-to guy.

### **Advantages of using Python**

One of the most interesting key features of Python is its ability to be easily read. You want to know why? Its syntax is designed to be easily understood and followed, with a focus on clear and concise code.

Did I mention that it is also a great language for collaborative programming and sharing codes with others? It is, and here’s the reason:

* It is easy to read and understand.
    
* It has a large community and open-source libraries. I.e., you can leverage on existing libraries and tools to speed up your development process and also collaborate with others using the same libraries.
    
* It can be integrated with other programming languages, allowing collaborations across different technologies.
    
* It has quite a number of online collaboration tools, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, which allow developers to share their code with others and collaborate on codes from different locations, just to mention a few.
    

One of the biggest advantages of Python is its versatility. From creating websites and applications to performing data analysis and machine learning, it can be used for a variety of jobs. Anyone engaged in programming would benefit from learning it because of this.

## Resources

Online tutorials, video courses, books, and other resources are all accessible to you if you're just getting started with Python. You can practice with easy programs right away by downloading Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

Overall, Python is a strong and user-friendly language that is suitable for both newcomers and experienced programmers. Python is a fantastic language to learn and investigate, regardless of your interests, which may range from web development to data science or anything in between.

oh, here's a little bonus for you. If you're looking to pivot into tech but don't have enough money to run paid online courses, Northwest Arkansas Community College is sponsoring people to learn digital/tech skills. They have paid for a few Google certification courses via Coursera. All you need to do is register through their link below, and start learning. You're welcome!
